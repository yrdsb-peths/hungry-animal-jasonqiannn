Gapple Feature: At the start of each game, a fast golden apple that moves 4x the speed of a normal apple will spawn and everytime you eat it, another one spawns in quickly. The purpose of this feature is to speed up the game since it takes eating 10 apples, gold or normal in order for the games difficulty and speed to increase, and it is a challenge to juggle between the normal apple and golden apple.
